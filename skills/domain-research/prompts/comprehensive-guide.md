├── [Foundation action 2]
└── Milestone: [First measurable outcome]

NEXT (Month 4-6)
├── [Expansion action 1]
├── [Expansion action 2]
└── Milestone: [Second measurable outcome]

LATER (Month 7-12)
├── [Scale action 1]
├── [Scale action 2]

## Design Principles

1. **Scannable**: Use tables, bullets, and visual hierarchy
2. **Actionable**: Every section should inform a decision or action
3. **Honest**: Clearly indicate confidence levels and limitations
4. **Complete**: Cover findings, actions, metrics, and risks
5. **Focused**: One page maximum, no filler content

---
