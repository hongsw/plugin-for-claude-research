  topic:
    goal_statement: |
      Implement AI-powered staff scheduling to optimize nurse allocation,
      reduce overtime costs, and improve patient care quality within
      a 6-month pilot period.
    problem_statement: |
      Current manual scheduling leads to chronic understaffing in some
      departments while overstaffing in others, resulting in $2M+
      annual overtime costs and staff burnout.
    scope:
      included:
        - "Nurse scheduling optimization"
        - "Demand forecasting integration"
        - "Preference management systems"
        - "Real-time adjustment capabilities"
      excluded:
        - "Physician scheduling (different constraints)"
        - "Patient admission optimization"
        - "Clinical decision support"

      - metric: "Schedule generation time"
        target: "90% reduction (from 8 hours to <1 hour)"
      - metric: "Shift vacancy rate"
        target: "<5% open shifts within 48 hours of shift start"
    qualitative:
      - indicator: "Staff scheduling satisfaction"
