# Healthcare AI: Staff Scheduling Optimization

This example demonstrates the research framework applied to healthcare operations.

## Research Context

**Field**: Healthcare AI - Hospital Operations
**Topic**: AI-powered staff scheduling optimization
**Timeline**: 6-month pilot

## Stakeholders

| Role | Need | Success Metric |
|------|------|----------------|
| Hospital Administrator | Reduce costs | 20% overtime reduction |
| Nursing Director | Fair scheduling | >75% satisfaction |
| IT Director | System integration | Zero downtime |

## Sample Conversation Flow

```
User: "I'm curious about AI in healthcare."

Claude: "That's a vast space. Let's narrow it down:
        - Are you in the healthcare industry yourself?
        - Any particular aspect - clinical, administrative, research?"

User: "I'm a hospital administrator. Looking at how AI could
      help with scheduling and resource management."

Claude: "Ah, operational AI for hospitals.
        - What problems are you seeing with current scheduling?
        - What resources are hardest to manage?"

User: "Staff scheduling is the nightmare. Always short in some
      areas, overstaffed in others."

Claude: "Got it. AI for staff scheduling optimization.
        - What's your timeline for potential implementation?
        - Any system integration requirements?"

User: "6 months to pilot. Must work with Kronos and Epic."

Claude: "Clear constraints. One more:
        - Is there union involvement in scheduling decisions?"

User: "Yes, strong union. That's a concern."

Claude: "Important factor. Here's your research context:
        [Generated YAML]
        Does this capture it?"
```

## Key Research Questions Generated

1. What AI scheduling approaches succeed in unionized hospitals?
2. How to balance staff preferences with optimization?
3. What change management reduces AI scheduling resistance?
4. What integration patterns work for Kronos/Epic?
5. What's realistic ROI for first year?

## Expected Pipeline Outputs

- **Step 1**: 5 prioritized research questions
- **Step 2**: Gaps in healthcare AI scheduling literature
- **Step 3**: Analysis of 3-5 case studies
- **Step 4**: Integrated findings with vendor comparison
- **Step 5**: Implementation roadmap with union strategy
