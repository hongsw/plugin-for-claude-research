# Manufacturing AI 2026 Example

This example demonstrates the full research pipeline for Manufacturing AI practitioner education.

## Research Context

**Field**: Manufacturing AI
**Topic**: Enable manufacturing practitioners to study AI technology and principles in 2026, apply them internally, and scale with confidence.

## Stakeholders

| Role | Expertise | Primary Need |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Image Generation AI Professor | Generative models, CV | Bridge academic AI to manufacturing |
| Smart Factory Professor | MES, factory automation | Integrate AI with existing infrastructure |
| MES System Manager | 15+ years manufacturing | Practical AI within MES constraints |
| Tech-CEO | Business strategy | Confident transition to AI-driven ops |

## Files in This Example

```
manufacturing-ai-2026/
├── research-context.yaml    # Structured context from intent analysis
└── README.md               # This file
```

## Pipeline Execution

To run the full pipeline with this example:

```bash
# Load the research context
claude --skill manufacturing-ai-research

# Reference this example
/research-pipeline --context examples/manufacturing-ai-2026/research-context.yaml
```

## Expected Outputs

After running the pipeline, you should have:

1. **5 Key Research Questions** focused on:
   - Practitioner learning pathways
   - MES-AI integration patterns
   - Pilot-to-production scaling
   - Change management strategies
   - ROI measurement frameworks

2. **4 Priority Research Gaps** including:
   - Domain-expert AI education models
   - Legacy system integration patterns
   - Organizational readiness assessment
   - Regional manufacturing AI ecosystems

3. **Synthesis** of manufacturing AI literature

4. **Action Plan** with:
   - 6-month implementation roadmap
   - Success metrics (3 pilots, 80% confidence)
   - Risk mitigation strategies

5. **Comprehensive Guide** (1-page practitioner roadmap)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Practitioners can independently study AI technology
- [ ] 3+ pilot projects launched per organization
- [ ] 50% of pilots scaled to production
- [ ] >80% practitioner confidence score
