# FinTech: Blockchain for Cross-Border Payments

This example demonstrates the research framework applied to financial technology strategy.

## Research Context

**Field**: FinTech - Blockchain & DLT
**Topic**: Blockchain viability for cross-border payments
**Timeline**: Q2 2026 investment decision

## Stakeholders

| Role | Need | Success Metric |
|------|------|----------------|
| Head of Strategy | Investment recommendation | Board-ready go/no-go |
| CTO | Technical feasibility | Architecture assessment |
| CCO | Regulatory compliance | Risk matrix by jurisdiction |

## Sample Conversation Flow

```
User: "I need to research blockchain for my company's strategy team."

Claude: "Let's make sure this lands well:
        - What industry is your company in?
        - What does strategy team want - evaluate investment,
          find use cases, understand competition?"

User: "We're a bank. They want to know if we should invest in
      blockchain for cross-border payments."

Claude: "Much clearer. Research focus:
        - Blockchain viability for cross-border payments in banking
        - Purpose: Investment decision support

        What's their decision timeline?"

User: "Board wants recommendation by Q2 next year."

Claude: "Good timeline. A few more:
        - Are you looking at specific blockchain platforms?
        - Any regulatory jurisdictions that are priorities?"

User: "US, EU, and Asia-Pacific are key markets.
      No specific platform - that's what we need to figure out."

Claude: "Got it. And what's the board's general stance on crypto/blockchain?
        Conservative? Open? This affects how we frame the research."

User: "Very conservative. They're skeptical of anything 'crypto'."

Claude: "Important context. We'll need to clearly distinguish
        enterprise blockchain from speculative crypto.

        Here's your research context:

        Does this capture your needs?"
```

## Key Research Questions Generated

1. Which blockchain platforms have regulatory acceptance for payments?
2. What's the realistic timeline for CBDC interoperability?
3. What are total costs (beyond transaction fees) of blockchain adoption?
4. Which competitors are furthest along and what can we learn?
5. How to present blockchain to a crypto-skeptical board?

## Expected Pipeline Outputs

- **Step 1**: 5 prioritized research questions with methodology
- **Step 2**: Gaps in enterprise blockchain payment research
- **Step 3**: Analysis of competitor pilots and CBDC initiatives
- **Step 4**: Integrated market and regulatory landscape
- **Step 5**: Investment recommendation with scenario analysis
